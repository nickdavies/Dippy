> **Stop the permission fatigue.** Claude Code asks for approval on every `ls`, `git status`, and `cat` - destroying your flow state. You check Slack, come back, and your assistant's just sitting there waiting.

Dippy is a shell command hook that auto-approves safe commands while still prompting for anything destructive. When it blocks, your custom deny messages can steer the AI back on track—no wasted turns. Get up to **40% faster development** without disabling permissions entirely.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Gemini CLI**.

Built on [Parable](https://github.com/ldayton/Parable), our own hand-written bash parser—no external dependencies, just pure Python. 14,000+ tests between the two.

## ✅ What gets approved

- **Complex pipelines**: `ps aux | grep python | awk '{print $2}' | head -10`
- **Chained reads**: `git status && git log --oneline -5 && git diff --stat`
- **Cloud inspection**: `aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=prod"`
- **Container debugging**: `docker logs --tail 100 api-server 2>&1 | grep ERROR`
- **Safe redirects**: `grep -r "TODO" src/ 2>/dev/null`, `ls &>/dev/null`
- **Command substitution**: `ls $(pwd)`, `git diff foo-$(date).txt`

## 🚫 What gets blocked

- **Subshell injection**: `git $(echo rm) foo.txt`, `echo $(rm -rf /)`
- **Subtle file writes**: `curl https://example.com > script.sh`, `tee output.log`
- **Hidden mutations**: `git stash drop`, `npm unpublish`, `brew unlink`
- **Cloud danger**: `aws s3 rm s3://bucket --recursive`, `kubectl delete pod`
- **Destructive chains**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` (blocks the whole thing)

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap ldayton/dippy
brew install dippy
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ldayton/Dippy.git
```

### Configure

#### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or use `/hooks` interactively):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "dippy" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

WARNING: While Dippy does support the input and ouput formats expected by Cursor the latest version of Cursor's use of hooks is broken and integrates pooly with their sandbox and network sandbox system. You have two choices:
1) Use Dippy as an extra layer: With `beforeShellExecution` it honors the Deny response but then will still prompt on Allow or Ask.
2) Forgo protections for non-shell commands: This is NOT recommended but with the `preToolUse` hook in cursor Allow/Deny work but Ask is treated as "no opinion" so it falls through. So you can set Cursor to "run everything" but this approves all tool use, Read, Write, WebSearch etc automatically as well.

Add to `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (global) or `.cursor/hooks.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Shell", "command": "dippy" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `matcher` ensures Dippy only runs for shell commands, not every tool invocation.

Dippy auto-detects Cursor's input format, so no extra flags are needed. If you prefer to be explicit, use `dippy --cursor` or set `DIPPY_CURSOR=1`.

Logs go to `~/.cursor/hook-approvals.log`.

> **Note:** Cursor has a known bug where only the first hook in an array runs. If you have other hooks of the same type, Dippy must be listed first.

> **Note:** Cursor's `beforeShellExecution` hook has a known bug where `allow` responses are ignored — only `deny` works correctly. Use `preToolUse` instead, however this does NOT respect `ask` commands.

> **Note:** Cursor's sandbox mode bypasses hook permission decisions. Commands that run in the sandbox are auto-approved regardless of what the hook returns. Only unsandboxed commands (those requiring `required_permissions`) respect `allow` and `deny` responses.

If you installed manually, use the full path instead: `/path/to/Dippy/bin/dippy-hook`

---

## Configuration

Dippy is highly customizable. Beyond simple allow/deny rules, you can attach messages that steer the AI back on track when it goes astray—no wasted turns.

```
deny python "Use uv run python, which runs in project environment"
deny rm -rf "Use trash instead"
deny-redirect **/.env* "Never write secrets, ask me to do it"
```

Dippy reads config from `~/.dippy/config` (global) and `.dippy` in your project root.

## Extensions

Dippy can do more than filter shell commands. See the [wiki](https://github.com/ldayton/Dippy/wiki) for additional capabilities.

---

## Uninstall

Remove the hook entry from `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.cursor/hooks.json`, then:

```bash
brew uninstall dippy  # if installed via Homebrew
```
